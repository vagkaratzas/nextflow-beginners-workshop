# Nextflow workshop for beginners
This repository contains a small list of Nextflow-related branch-lessons for beginners.
Each lesson is a different branch, so make sure to change branches incrementally.
Each branch/lesson contains all required files, along with the command to execute.
The point is to see step by step, how a Nextflow pipeline can be minimally built and then extended step-by-step.

Choose the `Lesson-1` branch to begin!
