# Nextflow workshop for beginners
This repository contains a small list of Nextflow-related branch-lessons for beginners.
Each lesson is a different branch, so make sure to change branches incrementally.
Each branch/lesson contains all required files, along with the command to execute.
The point is to see step by step, how a Nextflow pipeline can be minimally built and then extended step-by-step.

Clone this repository on your local machine with the command `git clone https://github.com/vagkaratzas/nextflow-beginners-workshop.git`, open the downloaded directory with your favorite editor (highly recommend [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)), and fetch all branches/lessons with `git fetch --all`.

Make sure to install Nextflow by following the steps [here](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/install.html).
To check if Nextflow was installed correctly, execute the command `nextflow -v`. If you see the software's version, you can proceed!

Switch to the `Lesson-1` branch to begin.
